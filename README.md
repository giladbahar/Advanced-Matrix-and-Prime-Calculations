Description
This project is part of an advanced programming workshop, focusing on prime number calculations and matrix manipulations. The project includes three main exercises.


Features:

Prime Number Sums:
A function that calculates prime numbers within a given range [n1,n2]
and computes the sum of their digits.
Results are stored dynamically in a struct array that includes the prime number and its digit sum

Matrix Neighbor Maximums:
A function that processes a matrix and returns a new matrix where each element contains the maximum value of its neighbors.
The neighbors of each element are defined as the adjacent cells (up, down, left, right), except for edge cases.

Matrix-Based Lists:
A function that creates two linked lists based on conditions from matrix elements:
List 1: Elements where the sum of the row and column indices 
(i+j) equals the element's value.
List 2: Elements that, together with their row and column indices, form an arithmetic sequence.

How to Run
Clone the repository.
Compile the code with a C compiler.
Run the program and follow the instructions for each exercise.
